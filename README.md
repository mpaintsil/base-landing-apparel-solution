### The Challenge

In this challenge, I was required to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

<img src="./images/screenshot mobile portrait.png?raw=true" width="100%" alt="mobile view portrait"/>

### Solution

I used HTML and CSS to build the page.
The email validation ensures that the input field only accepts text formatted as an email address.
Additionally, the form cannot be submitted if the field is empty.
