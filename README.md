# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page

## Welcome! 

This is my solution for front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

In this challenge I was required to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
